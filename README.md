## Overview

Air pollution is a critical public health challenge, with industrial emissions contributing significantly to
particulate matter in the atmosphere.Wet scrubbers are widely employed to mitigate these emissions, making
improvements in their efficiency an impactful pursuit. In this study, we analyze an atypical approach to liquid
distribution in wet scrubbers that uses liquid flowing down vertical fibers. In this situation, the liquid film
naturally destabilizes into periodic drops that flow along the fiber, offering several benefits. These include
extended residence time, reduced pressure drop, monodisperse drop sizes and tunability of all of these,
including the drop number density. The residence time and drop number density are the most significant of
the aforementioned effects and are strongly affected by liquid properties. Accordingly, we chose to study
silicone oils, available in a range of viscosities, to investigate the particle-capture efficiency of fiber-guided
drops in various conditions, and demonstrate their potential to enhance the performance of wet scrubbers.
Additionally, we identify optimal system parameters for effectively capturing particles across a range of
particle diameters, paving the way for a more efficient and adaptable design for industrial air pollution
control.
